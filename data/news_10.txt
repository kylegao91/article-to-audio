WASHINGTON—The Biden administration is preparing a new program that could prohibit U.S. investment in certain sectors in China, a new step to guard U.S. technology advantages during a growing competition between the world’s two largest economies.

In reports provided to lawmakers Friday on Capitol Hill, the Treasury and Commerce departments said they were considering a new regulatory system to address U.S. investment in advanced technologies abroad that could pose national security risks, according to copies of the reports viewed by The Wall Street Journal.

The reports said the Biden administration may prohibit some investments while also potentially collecting information about other investments to inform future steps.

While the reports didn’t identify specific technology sectors the Biden administration views as risky, it said sectors that could advance rivals’ military capabilities would be a focus of the program.

Russian advances into the northern suburbs of Bakhmut are placing severe pressure on Ukrainian forces there, the U.K. Ministry of Defense said Saturday in its bleakest assessment yet of the situation in the embattled eastern city.

Russia has made Bakhmut its main target in recent months and is seeking to cut the city off, advancing from the north, south and east. Ukraine sent elite units to reinforce the area, and two bridges in and around Bakhmut have been blown up in the past two days, including one that connects the city to the last main supply route to the town of Chasiv Yar to the west, the U.K. ministry said.

“Ukrainian-held resupply routes out of the town are increasingly limited,” the U.K. ministry said in its daily analysis.

Ukraine’s military said Saturday it was repelling Russian assaults. The Institute for the Study of War, a Washington-based think tank, said Ukrainian troops could be preparing to pull out of at least part of the city.

Amazon.com Inc.’s decision to delay building part of its Virginia office campus is the latest sign that fading demand from technology companies is becoming a problem for the commercial real-estate sector.

Tech giants like Amazon, Alphabet Inc. and Microsoft Corp. for years drove demand for office space, helping prop up building values in cities like New York, San Francisco and Washington, D.C.

Now many of these firms are canceling leases, putting space up for sublease and rolling back plans to buy or build offices as they lay off workers and look to cut costs. That is putting pressure on building owners at a time when they are already grappling with weak demand from other industries and a rise in interest rates.

“The one thing to hang your hat on for a lot of office owners was that tech demand,” said John Kim, a real-estate stock analyst and managing director at BMO Capital Markets. “We didn’t realize it would be this bad this fast.”

Facebook META 6.14%increase; green up pointing triangle parent Meta Platforms Inc. said it would work to implement many of an outside advisory group’s recommendations to reform a system for VIP users called “cross check,” but rejected important provisions intended to enhance transparency and prevent political favoritism.

Meta made the announcements Friday in a formal response to 32 recommendations issued in a December report about cross check from its oversight board, an outside body that the company empowered to make binding decisions on specific content-moderation controversies and offer suggestions on broader topics.

Meta, which also owns apps including Instagram, has described cross check as a quality-control effort to prevent moderation errors on content of heightened public interest. In effect, it protects high-profile accounts from the company’s normal enforcement processes pending additional review—a standard, if rarely discussed, practice among social-media platforms that creates the potential for special treatment.

A Wall Street Journal article in September 2021 revealed that internal company reviews of the program said that it suffered from poor oversight and favoritism. In one case, for example, Facebook’s senior leaders had intervened to shield an internationally famous soccer star from its normal penalty for posting nonconsensual nude images.

Regulators are going after crypto staking, most recently with a $30 million fine in February against a crypto exchange called Kraken.

The move has big implications for the crypto industry. Here’s what you need to know.

What is crypto staking?
Staking helps some crypto networks process and validate transactions. Staking is employed by several popular networks including Cardano, Solana and Ethereum, which hosts the No. 2 cryptocurrency, ether.

At a high level, staking works like this: Crypto investors can essentially pledge their computing power and crypto holdings to a network for a specified period.

The “staked” crypto tokens act as collateral that can be destroyed or confiscated if the investor misbehaves. The idea is that investors won’t try to undermine a network—by reversing transactions, for instance—if their own tokens are on the line.

Isha Ambani Piramal recently spent hours trying to borrow a car-size sculpture of a whale’s heart. She hoped to include the bindi-covered piece by Bharti Kher, An Absence of Assignable Cause, in the inaugural exhibit of her family’s new kunsthalle-style space in Mumbai, Art House. Yet with the show opening to the public April 2 and some shipping details still to be sorted, the Yale- and Stanford-educated director of India’s largest retailer, Reliance Retail, was learning firsthand the logistical travails of a museum director seeking to turn vision into reality.

“It’s still so complex to get some pieces around India,” she says, “but I’m hopeful we can get it.” (She did.)

Over the past decade, Ambani Piramal, 31, and her mother, Nita M. Ambani, have steadily gained a reputation in international art circles for helping fund museum shows of Indian art around the world, backed by the $83 billion fortune of Ambani Piramal’s father, Mukesh Ambani, who runs the textile and petroleum empire Reliance Industries Ltd. The family’s Reliance Foundation is the main funder of the Metropolitan Museum of Art’s upcoming summer show on the origins of Buddhist art in India. Yet the plan all along, Ambani Piramal says, was to start convincing faraway museums to send more of their blockbuster traveling shows to India and for the family to support edgy shows closer to home.

Curators told her the country needed a venue outfitted with all the latest security and climate-control technologies, features lagging in some state-run institutions. So as early as 2016, she says, her family set out to build their own alternative, spending an undisclosed sum. “We want museums to send their works to us and breathe easy,” she says.

Fawzia Anwari, an Afghan widow, used to earn enough from her job at a foreign nongovernmental organization in Kabul to support her five children, the eldest of whom enrolled at university to study economics.

But in December, the family lost their sole livelihood when the Taliban banned women from working at NGOs, one of the few places where the Taliban had still allowed Afghan women to work.

Ms. Anwari had to pull her oldest son out of university. With her savings, she bought him a wheelbarrow, which he now pushes around the streets of Kabul, hawking secondhand goods such as old radios and kitchenware.

“I have no financial supporters. We put our faith in my son,” said Ms. Anwari. “It breaks us when he doesn’t sell anything.”

For car buyers, a new reality is setting in: You don’t necessarily have to pay more to go electric. The automobile industry may never be the same.

There are some qualifiers, but the bottom line is a potentially momentous change.

With recent price declines,  the cost to to buy and operate some electric vehicles over several years is now roughly on par with their gasoline-powered counterparts. The considerable government subsidies available to EV buyers—including a federal credit of up to $7,500 for qualified buyers and vehicles—play a part in this. But in some cases, EVs and their conventional equivalents are at cost parity even without those.

It’s true that many electric vehicles still have a higher list price than their gas equivalents. But that gap is closing. We are now at the point that the considerable savings on fuel and maintenance costs that an EV offers can make up that difference, for some vehicles, over the first 2 to 5 years of their lives. Those savings also translate to an equal or lower monthly cost to own many EVs, when you add up the loan payment and fuel costs.

Amazon.com Inc.’s halt to construction of a new headquarters, on top of a parade of high-profile tech layoffs, looks ominous for the economy. But the damage will need to spread much further to signal full-blown recession.

When the U.S. has entered recession in the past, weakness has often started in one sector and then spread like brushfire, pulling down a widening array of industries and the people who work in them.

Downturns in 2001 and 2007-09 were apt examples. The deflated internet and telecommunications bubble in the early 2000s and then the mortgage and housing crunch of the mid-2000s emanated outward, damaging financial companies, consumer spending and business investment. That ultimately led to economywide recessions and widespread layoffs.

Yet a close read of recent history is more reassuring. Some industry fires don’t spread. In 2015, a fracking bust took down the energy sector but the economic expansion went on to become the longest on record.

BEIJING—China set an economic growth target of around 5% for the year, the lowest level in more than a quarter-century, as Beijing seeks to shake off the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic that knocked the economy off its growth target in 2022.

China’s target, announced by Premier Li Keqiang on Sunday at the start of the country’s annual legislative session, was lower than the 5.5% gross domestic product growth target set by Beijing last year.

In reality, the world’s second-largest economy grew 3% from a year earlier, held back by the government’s stringent Covid controls and a prolonged property slump—the slowest rate of growth in recent memory, with the exception of Covid-hit 2020, when officials opted to forgo a growth target.

This year’s lower growth target comes amid signs of a solid economic recovery in the first two months of the year following the dismantling of Covid-related restrictions beginning late last year. Official and private gauges of China’s manufacturing, service and construction activities all rebounded strongly.
